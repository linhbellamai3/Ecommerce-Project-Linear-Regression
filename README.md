# Ecommerce-Project-Linear-Regression
First machine learning project using linear regression
Data about a fictitious Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. I will use linear regression to figure out the relationship bewteen different attributes and the yearly amount spent by customers. From that, I will recommend if the company should focus on their mobil app experience or their website.
